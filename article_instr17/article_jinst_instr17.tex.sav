\section{Introduction}
\hspace*{\parindent}


The energy calibration of nuclear recoil detectors is of
primary importance to rare-event experiments
\cite{NobleRev} such as those of direct dark matter
search and coherent neutrino-nucleus scattering. Such a
calibration, in particular in liquid Ar and Xe detection media, is
usually performed by measuring the ionization yield and
scintillation efficiency of nuclear recoils, using neutron elastic
scattering off nuclei (the latter imitating the interaction with
dark matter particle or coherently scattered neutrino).
While for liquid Xe there is an ample of experimental data on such
yields \cite{LXeYield1,LXeYield2,LXeYield3}, little is known  about
the ionization yield \cite{Joshi,Cao} and scintillation efficiency
\cite{LArScint} in liquid Ar.

Recently the first results on the ionization yield of nuclear
recoils in liquid Ar have been presented, in the lower energy range:
at 6.7 keV \cite{Joshi} and 17-57 keV \cite{Cao}.
\textbf{In addition, we have measured ionization yield of nuclear recoils in liquid Ar in the higher energy range: at 80 and 233 keV \cite{IonYield_80_233_keV}. 
In the present work we continue to measure ionization yield of nuclear recoils in liquid Ar at 233 keV.}
These results complement those measurements and might be relevant to the future dark matter
search experiments \cite{ArDM,Darkside} and to thorough
understanding of the ionization yield in liquid Ar. The
measurements were performed using a dedicated two-phase Cryogenic
Avalanche Detector (CRAD) \cite{CRADRev} and DD neutron generator.

The ionization yield measured in experiment is defined as follows:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq.1} Q_y=n_e/E_0
\end{equation}
Here  $n_e$ is the number of electrons escaping recombination with
positive ions; it depends on the energy deposited by a recoil
nuclear in the liquid ($E_0$) and on the electric field in the
liquid ($\mathcal{E}$). $n_e$  is always smaller than the initial
number of ion pairs produced in the liquid by a nuclear recoil
($N_i$). In the absence of a complete recombination model, it is
generally accepted that the following parametrization
works well \cite{NobleRev,Barabash93}:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq.2} n_e=\frac{N_i}{1 + k/\mathcal{E}}
\end{equation}
where $k$ is a fitting constant.

Equations \eqref{eq.1} and \eqref{eq.2} are valid for both electron recoils,
induced by electron or gamma-ray irradiation, and nuclear recoils;
it is conventional to refer to the corresponding recoil
energy in units of keVee (electron-equivalent) and keVnr. The goal
of the present study is to measure $Q_y$ for nuclear recoils in
liquid Ar at certain energies and electric field and to compare it
with that calculated using existing theoretical models.

\section{Experimental setup}
Figures~\ref{image:setup_3d} and~\ref{image:setup_2d} show the experimental setup \textbf{which} was similar to that used in our previous
studies of two-phase CRADs in Ar \cite{PropEluctroLumInAr}.

\end{figure}


\textbf{In the two-phase CRAD,
the primary ionization (electron) charge produced in the liquid by a
particle, drifts towards a liquid-gas interface under an electric
field, where it is emitted into the gas phase and drift in a moderate electric field in an electroluminescence (EL) gap located directly above the liquid-gas interface.}
The experimental setup included a
vacuum-insulated cryostat with a \textbf{9-l volume} cryogenic chamber. The
chamber consisted of a cathode mesh, immersed in a 0.8 cm thick
liquid Ar layer, and a double-THGEM assembly with an active area of
10$\times$10 cm$^2$, placed in the gas phase above the liquid. The
detector was operated in a two-phase mode in the equilibrium state,
at a saturated vapour pressure of 1.0 atm and at a temperature of 87
K. The Ar was purified by an Oxisorb filter,
providing an electron life-time \textbf{of $\ge$100 $\mu$s} in the liquid \cite{Two-phaseCRAD}.

The primary ionization charge in liquid Ar was produced by either
X-rays from a $^{241}$Am source having among others a 59.5 keV line,
or DD neutron generator. The detector was irradiated from outside,
practically uniformly across the active area, through two Al windows
located at the \textbf{chamber's bottom -> chamber bottom}.

To produce neutrons a specially designed  neutron generator was used
that continuously emitted monoenergetic neutrons (not collimated)
with the kinetic energy of 2.45 MeV obtained in the DD fusion
reaction \cite{NScatProp, NGen}. The neutron flux was of the order
\textbf{of 10$^4$ s$^{-1}$ over full} solid angle.  The neutron generator
(operated at 80 kV and wrapped in a 1 cm thick Pb screen to suppress
bremsstrahlung gamma-rays) was placed underneath the two-phase CRAD
at a distance of about 10 cm from the active volume.

The EL gap was viewed by four compact cryogenic 2-inch PMTs R6041-506MOD, located on the perimeter of the gap.
The signals were digitized and processed online with a
LeCroy~HRO~66Z digital oscilloscope.

The trigger was provided by the signals from the two-phase CRAD
itself at a detection threshold equivalent \textbf{to the energy of 8 keVee},
well above the electronic noises. At this threshold the typical
detector rate under neutron irradiation was of the \textbf{order of 80
s$^{-1}$}, and DAQ \textbf{had 25\% miscounts}. Each
experimental session was composed of several measurement runs: that
with neutron generator on, that with neutron generator off (to
measure the cosmic and detector internal backgrounds) and those of
the charge-scale and energy-resolution calibration using a 59.9
X-ray line from $^{241}$Am source.


\section{Experimental results}

Figure~\ref{SpectrRaw} shows the raw \textbf{integral} spectra in the
measurement runs at an electric field of 0.56 kV/cm: two pulse-integral
distributions, obtained in the runs when the neutron generator was
on and off, are presented. To obtain the real neutron
scattering-induced spectrum, the latter should be subtracted from
the former. To calibrate the integral scale in terms of the primary
ionization charge, the detector was also irradiated with X-rays from
$^{241}$Am source in the calibration runs: see the inset in the
figure. In addition in these calibration runs the \textbf{energy}
resolution of the detector was measured using the 59.5
keV line: it amounted to $\sigma$/E=29\% and  $\sigma$/E=23\% at an electric field of 0.56 and 0.62 kV/cm respectively. The resolution
is expected to be reasonably spatially uniform and
practically independent of the energy, being mostly defined by the
gain non-uniformity \textbf{in the EL gap} and the fluctuations of the
slow component of an electron emission though the liquid-gas
interface \cite{TPAr-Emission}.

subtracting the background-run contribution, but before subtracting
the gamma-ray contribution, the latter being fitted by a linear
decreasing function. Here the energy scale calibration was performed
using the 59.5 keV X-ray line.}
		\label{SpectrNeutron}}
\end{figure}

In eq.~\eqref{eq.1} one should first determine $n_e$ from the spectra of
figure~\ref{SpectrRaw}. For this the pulse-integral in the
figure should be normalized to that of 59.5 keV peak and then
converted to the primary ionization charge. For the latter one
should know, in turn, the ionization yield for 59.5 keV X-rays in
liquid Ar. Since the experimental data on this quantity were not
available in the literature, we conducted a special intermediate
study on the ionization yields for electron-equivalent recoils,
namely for X-rays and electrons absorbed in liquid Ar and Xe.

In liquid Xe, where
there are enough experimental data in the energy range of interest,
the relative ionization yield dependence on energy is perfectly
described by a\textbf{ function $n_e/N_i=a/(1+b/E_0)$ with $a$ and $b$
parameters}. Accordingly, in liquid Ar we used the similar
function, firstly, to describe the experimental data and, secondly,
to extrapolate the data to the energy point of interest. In liquid
Ar however there was a lack of data in the low energy domain. In
this domain the data point at 35 keV was obtained ourselves in the previous work~\cite{IonYield_80_233_keV}.

Finally, to calculate $n_e$ (as well as $Q_y$) from $n_e/N_i$, we
used a $W$-value (energy needed to produce one ion pair) and its
definition, $W=E_0/N_i$: $W=23.6$ eV in liquid Ar (see table 2 in
ref. \cite{NobleRev}).

After subtracting the background-run contribution, the \textbf{integral}
distribution still contains the gamma-ray background, \textbf{resulted from
($n,\gamma$) reactions in surrounding materials (H, C, Ar, Fe, Pb, etc. nuclei) with energies above 0.6 MeV.}

At these photon energies the spectrum of electron recoils
due to Compton scattering at the given recoil energies can be
approximated by a linear decreasing function with energy (see figure
10.1 in ref. \cite{Knoll}). Accordingly in liquid Ar the gamma-ray
contribution due to Compton scattering appeared in the energy
spectrum as a long tail extending to higher energies, fitted by a
linear decreasing function: see the inset in
figure~\ref{SpectrNeutron}.

Figure~\ref{SpectrNeutron} shows the desired ionization charge
spectrum in liquid Ar induced by nuclear recoils due to neutron
scattering; the spectrum is obtained from figure~\ref{SpectrRaw} using
59.5 keV X-ray line calibration and subtracting the background-run
and gamma-ray contributions. The next step is to compare this
experimental spectrum to that of theoretical.

The theoretical  spectrum was computed using simulation code {\it
Scattronix} developed in the Budker INP~\cite{NSpectr} and
differential cross-sections of elastic and inelastic neutron
scattering \cite{NData}. For the $^{40}$Ar nuclei irradiated by
neutrons with the energy of 2.45 MeV it is shown in
figure~\ref{SpectrTheory}. One can see that the maximum recoil energy
for the Ar nuclei, achieved for backward neutron scattering at
180$^o$, is 233 keV. The convolution of the theoretical spectrum
with the energy resolution of the two-phase CRAD obtained in
experiment (29\,\%), is also shown; just this spectrum should be
compared to that of experimental. Two components of neutron
scattering are distinctly seen in the figure: those of the forward
and backward scattering, respectively represented in the
distribution by the peak at lower energies and the shoulder at
higher energies. These two components are well reproduced in the
experimental spectrum in figure~\ref{SpectrNeutron}. It is interesting
that the backward scattering component (the shoulder) in both the
experimental and theoretical spectra is well approximated by a
linear function: see figure~\ref{SpectrNeutron} and the inset in
figure~\ref{SpectrTheory}.

One cannot directly fit the theoretical spectrum to that of
experimental in order to obtain the ionization yield, due to the
unknown energy dependence of the yield. On the other hand, one can
select the characteristic points at certain nuclear recoil energies
in both the experimental and theoretical spectra and calculate the
ionization yield at these points according to eq.~(\ref{eq.1}). Namely
at these points, one should divide the ionization charge value (in
the experimental spectrum) by that of the nuclear recoil energy (in
the theoretical spectrum). Fortunately, the mathematically justified
choice of such point can be done with respect to the linear
function fit of the backward scattering component (see the inset in
figure~\ref{SpectrTheory}).\textbf{ This point, characterizing the
spectrum end-point, is that of the horizontal axis intersection of
the linear function. The nuclear recoil energy which should be attributed to this point is 233 keV.}
The ionization yield values at two electric fields
measured in that way are as follows: $Q_y=5.9\pm0.8\,e^-$/keV at 0.56
kV/cm and $Q_y=7.4\pm1\,e^-$/keV at 0.62 kV/cm. These are presented in
table~\ref{tab.1}, showing also the appropriate statistic and systematic
uncertainties and their quadratic sum (total error).

\begin{table}
\caption{Ionization yields ($Q_y$) of nuclear recoils in liquid Ar
with uncertainties measured at 233 keV.}
\label{tab.1}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|lcccc|}
\hline
Electric field & $Q_y$ & Statistical & Systematic & Total\\
(kV/cm)& ($e^-$/keV) & & & error \\ [2mm]\hline
0.56  & 5.9 & 0.15 & 0.82 & 0.83\\
0.62  & 7.4 & 0.15 & 1.03 & 1.04 \\
\hline

\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{table}

In addition to the ionization yield, the ionization efficiency,
sometimes called the ionization quench factor, can be determined.
The ionization efficiency is defined by analogy with the
scintillation efficiency, i.e. as the ratio of the ionization yield
of nuclear recoils ($Q_{y,nr}$) to that of electron-equivalent
recoils ($Q_{y,ee}$), at the same energy:
$L_{ion}=Q_{y,nr}/Q_{y,ee}$. Combining the data of table~\ref{tab.1} and the data of
ionization yield of electron recoils, one can obtain that $L_{ion}$ amounts to
\textbf{0.31$\pm$0.06 at 0.56 kV/cm and 0.37$\pm$0.07 at 0.62 kV/cm}.


\subsection{Comparison with other experiments and with theoretical models}

Basically there are two theoretical models that can describe the
recombination effect in liquid noble gases and consequently the
energy and field dependence of the ionization yield of nuclear
recoils: that of Thomas-Imel \cite{TIModel1,TIModel2} and that of
Jaffe \cite{JaffeModel1,JaffeModel2}. 
Thomas-Imel model predicts the decreasing function of energy for the ionization yield, which in contrast to our previous measurements \cite{IonYield_80_233_keV} at 80 and 233 keV, 
so we used Jaffe model for analysis.

The Jaffe model \cite{JaffeModel1}
in its compact form \cite{JaffeModel2} has a Birks-like
equation,
\begin{equation}
\label{eq.6} n_e=\frac{N_i}{1+k_B(dE/dx)/\mathcal{E}}
\end{equation}

The equation for the ionization yield in the frame of this Jaffe
model:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq.7}
Q_y=\frac{f}{[1+k_B(dE/dx)/\mathcal{E}][E_g+E_{ph}(N_{ex}/N_i)]},
\end{equation}
Here $k_B$ is a constant; it was determined from an approximation of the data. 
The stopping
power (energy losses) for excitation and ionization, $dE/dx$, was
calculated using the SRIM program \cite{SRIM}.
$E_i=N_i E_g$ and $E_{ex}=N_{ex}E_{ph}$ (see
section 4 in ref. \cite{NobleRev} for more details of the energy
balance in liquid noble gases). Here $E_g\simeq 14.2$ eV is the band
gap in liquid Ar, which we adopt equal to that of solid Ar (see
table 2 in ref. \cite{NobleRev}); $E_{ph} = 9.7$~eV is the average
energy of scintillation photon. $f$ is the Lindhard factor (also called quench factor),
characterizing the nuclear recoil collisions; it is defined as the
energy fraction transferred to ionization ($E_i$) and excitation
($E_{ex}$):
\begin{equation}
\label{eq.5} f=(E_i+E_{ex})/E_0
\end{equation}

For electron recoils it is equal to unity. For nuclear recoils it
can be calculated in two ways: either taking the calculations of
Linhard et al. \cite{Lindhard} or using a SRIM computer program
\cite{SRIM} developed for low energy ion collisions. In the present
work we used the second method. 

$N_{ex}/N_i$ is the ratio of the number of excitations to
that of ionizations and can be taken here equal to that predicted for nuclear recoils in
ref.~\cite{IonYield_80_233_keV}, namely $N_{ex}/N_i = 2$. 

Figure~\ref{IonYieldVsE} shows the field dependence measured in experiment approximated with a rough model eq.~(\ref{eq.2}) or
with the Jaffe model eq.~(\ref{eq.7}), where $k_B$ is a free parameter.
The found value of $k_B$ parameter is $0.94 \pm 0.17 \left[ \frac{V \cdot mg}{keV \cdot cm^3} \right]$ and reduced $\chi^2 = 1.2$.
This result is consistent with $k_B = 1.35 \left[ \frac{V \cdot mg}{keV \cdot cm^3} \right]$ determined from the field
dependence of the data of ref.~\cite{Joshi} at 6.7 keV.
Also, $N_{ex}/N_i = 2$  is the appropriate value in the wide range of energies and the electric fields.
One can see that the Jaffe model can probably
consistently describe the experimental data in terms of the energy and field
dependence.

\section{Conclusions}

In the present work, the ionization yield of nuclear recoils in
liquid Ar has been measured at 233 keV, using a two-phase Cryogenic Avalanche
Detector (CRAD) and DD neutron generator. The ionization yield in
liquid Ar at an electric field of 0.56 and 0.62 kV/cm amounted to 5.9$\pm$0.8
and 7.4$\pm$1 e$^-$/keV respectively at 233 keV; the
ionization quench factor amounted to 0.31$\pm$0.06 and 0.37$\pm$0.07
respectively. \textbf{The Jaffe model can probably
consistently describe the experimental data in terms of the energy and field
dependence.} The results of such a
study is relevant to the energy calibration of liquid
noble gas detectors for dark matter search experiments and
understanding of the ionization yield in liquid Ar.
